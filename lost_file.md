5.When it's finished, please go to the PrivacySafe/LostFileRestore folder in the root directory of the device. 
<br><br>â€»IMPORTANT: Since the app cannot know the extension before the file is encrypted, so please modify the file extension yourself. For example, change the image extension to a format such as .jpg, and change the video extension to a format such as .mp4.
